# Nest.js + Node boilerplate

This repository contains the basic structure for a SPA project based on Vue 3 on the front-end side and Nest.js on the back-end side.

Both sides of the project use Typescript and the front-end project also includes Vitest and Cypress as testing libraries.
Optimized Prettier & Eslint for standard needs on both projects.
Does not include any choice of database or ORM for the Nest part.
